# Code Style Guidelines

## Imports
Use absolute imports where possible, relative imports only when necessary. Avoid wildcard imports.

## Formatting
Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide. Use snake_case for variable and function names, PascalCase for class names.

## Types
Make use of type hints for better code readability and to help with static type checking.

## Naming Conventions
Use descriptive names for classes, functions, variables, and constants that clearly express their purpose.

## Error Handling
Write robust error handling using try-except blocks where applicable.
